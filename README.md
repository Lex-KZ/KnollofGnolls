##Development, Purpose and Scope

####Description

A Knoll of Gnolls (KoG) is an interactive, text-based, choose your own adventure RPG, set in a high fantasy world and based on Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition mechanics. The user will choose the class and play their way through the jungles of Maydola. The class they pick will determine their skills and options, as they look for the stollen citizens of the town of Ruesin, on the trail of a ferocious pack of Gnolls, humanoid hyena like creatures. 

####Problem

Many high fantasy-based RPGs are heavily focused on fight mechanics rather than interaction with the players environment. KoG seeks to re-focus on that element of game-play, as the only way to make it through the game is to avoid combat and use the environment the user is presented with to their advantage.

####Target Audience

The target audience of KoG are those that have a solid grasp on how to use the terminal and have an interest in RPGs in a fantasy setting. Due to KoG being a terminal app, the user would need to know how to use the terminal. The game also relies on fantasy tropes in many of the choices that it presents to the user, and it would there for be useful for the user to have a passing familiarity with the genre.

####Target Audience Usage

The audience is to use this as entertainment. The users are to access the application through their operating system’s terminal client. 

##Features
- **Choosing a Character Class:** Users can pick from two character classes; Ranger and Sorcerer. Depending on their choice the user will have different class-based options, for example if dark vision is required a Ranger would equip night goggles, but a sorcerer would cast light. These options would affect the plot because as seen in the example, using goggles would be quiet and subtle, but casting light would then draw attention to the sorcerer. 
- **Inventory:** As the user makes their way through the story and locations, they will encounter items that may be used during the game, like a key or dynamite. The inventory will be stored externally with the user’s details. The depending on if they were found the objects would then be presented as options. For example, if presented with a locked door and the user found the key, they would then have the option of opening the door with the key. Once used, some items, such as dynamite, will be removed from the inventory.
- **Score Record:** When the player has completed the game, they will be given the score that they earned. The scores will be saved to an external file with the character name and could be viewed by future users.
